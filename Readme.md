# Setup

To setup the project, you can use one of the two scripts below (depending on your operating system). You must have Python 3.12 installed.

**Windows**

`./setup.ps1`

**Linux**

```
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

These scripts will set up a Python environment and install all necessary dependencies. Furthermore, all of the necessary models will be pulled and created.
