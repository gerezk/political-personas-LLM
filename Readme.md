# Setup

To setup the project, you can use one of the following two scripts (depending on your operating system):

**Windows**

`./setup.ps1`

**Linux**

`./setup.sh`

These scripts will setup a Python environment and install all necessary dependencies. Furthermore, all of the necessary models will be pulled and created.
