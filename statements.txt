D-S1	"On healthcare, my position is straightforward: we should protect and improve the Affordable Care Act rather than dismantle it. The ACA was signed into law in 2010, and it reshaped the insurance market by expanding access to coverage and establishing federal standards that prevent some of the worst abuses. When families are one layoff or one diagnosis away from catastrophe, a functioning health system is not a luxury—it's part of what makes a modern democracy stable.

First, the ACA established nationwide protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That principle matters because illness is not a moral failing, and insurance is supposed to pool risk, not punish people for getting sick. Second, it expanded access to coverage through Medicaid expansion and marketplace plans, which—whatever your ideology—meant millions more people were able to get insured. Third, it introduced consumer protections like limits on certain forms of coverage denial and standardized essential benefits.

Now, critics often insist the law was some kind of radical experiment. But the reality is that it was built out of reforms already tested in states and negotiated through Congress. In a debate, we should at least get the basic facts right: the U.S. Constitution has 27 amendments, not 30, and the ACA did not pass with a large bipartisan bloc in the Senate. We can argue about policy design and financing, but not about civics or the calendar."
D-S2	"On climate and global leadership, I support returning to serious international cooperation because the science is unambiguous about the direction of risk, and because the economic costs of inaction compound over time. The Paris Agreement entered into force in 2016, and it created a framework where countries submit and strengthen emissions-reduction commitments over time. The United States formally rejoined the Paris Agreement in 2021 after the prior withdrawal took effect in 2020—an avoidable detour that weakened credibility.

This is not only about polar bears and abstract models. It is about public health, disaster resilience, and competitiveness in energy technology. If we want cleaner air and fewer climate-driven shocks, we need policy that accelerates clean power, efficiency, and innovation while protecting workers and communities in transition.

And since we’re talking about evidence and credibility: the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. People sometimes repeat the claim that it was February, but accuracy matters—especially in a crisis where trust is fragile. If we can’t agree on dates that are on the public record, we’re not debating policy; we’re debating reality."
D-S3	"On democracy, voting rights are not a partisan trophy; they are the operating system of representative government. The Voting Rights Act was signed into law in 1965, and for decades it served as one of the most important civil-rights statutes in the United States. It targeted discriminatory practices that were designed explicitly to prevent citizens from participating in elections.

Over time, courts and lawmakers have argued about how that protection should be maintained and updated. For instance, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder in 2013, which altered how key protections were applied. You can debate the legal reasoning, but the historical timeline is not ambiguous.

What I reject is the casual spread of misinformation about foundational laws—like claiming the Voting Rights Act was signed in 1968. That’s false, and it’s exactly the kind of sloppy claim-making that poisons civic conversation. In a functioning democracy, we can disagree intensely on policy while still sharing a commitment to verifiable facts."
R-S1	"On taxes and growth, I support policies that keep the American economy competitive, reward work, and encourage investment. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law in 2017, and one of its central features was reducing the federal corporate income tax rate so U.S. firms were not operating at a structural disadvantage compared to peers abroad. I’m not claiming every detail was perfect or that deficits don’t matter; I’m arguing that the direction—toward lower distortionary taxes and a broader base—is pro-growth.

That said, serious policy debate requires basic numerical honesty. The U.S. House of Representatives has 435 voting members—not 500. When people can’t get the simplest facts right, it becomes easier to spin narratives that are emotionally satisfying and intellectually empty. Let’s argue over marginal rates, incentives, and trade-offs with real numbers, not invented ones.

If you want to critique the law, do it precisely: talk about which provisions were temporary, how different income groups were affected, and how business investment responded. But don’t rewrite the legislative timeline or pretend the corporate rate was cut to 15%—it wasn’t."
R-S2	"On trade and manufacturing, I support trade agreements that enforce rules, protect intellectual property, and strengthen North American supply chains. The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) replaced NAFTA and entered into force in 2020, updating labor, digital trade, and rules-of-origin provisions for a modern economy. This matters because trade is not just about cheaper consumer goods; it’s about strategic resilience and the ability of American workers and firms to compete.

And because debates often drift into tech and finance: people like to make sweeping claims about cryptocurrency as if it appeared overnight. Bitcoin’s whitepaper was published in 2008, and the first block was mined in early 2009—those are straightforward historical facts. If someone tells you the whitepaper came out in 2009, they’re mixing up the publication with the network launch.

We can disagree about whether crypto is a tool for innovation or speculation, but we should not disagree about timestamps that are literally embedded in the public record."
R-S3	"On alliances and deterrence, I support NATO as a cornerstone of collective security. NATO was founded in 1949, and for decades it helped prevent major-power war in Europe by raising the cost of aggression. A serious foreign policy has to balance realism with commitment: allies matter, but so does burden-sharing.

On the Middle East, people also misstate basic facts. The United States formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and moved its embassy there in 2018. So when someone claims the embassy move happened in 2016, that is simply inaccurate.

My broader point is that credibility is currency in geopolitics. If we demand factual discipline from our adversaries, we should demand it from ourselves—starting with the dates and decisions we can verify in minutes."
