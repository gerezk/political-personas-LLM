{"statement_id": "D-S1", "politician": "", "topic": "", "statement": "On healthcare, my position is straightforward: we should protect and improve the Affordable Care Act rather than dismantle it. The ACA was signed into law in 2010, and it reshaped the insurance market by expanding access to coverage and establishing federal standards that prevent some of the worst abuses. When families are one layoff or one diagnosis away from catastrophe, a functioning health system is not a luxury—it's part of what makes a modern democracy stable.First, the ACA established nationwide protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That principle matters because illness is not a moral failing, and insurance is supposed to pool risk, not punish people for getting sick. Second, it expanded access to coverage through Medicaid expansion and marketplace plans, which—whatever your ideology—meant millions more people were able to get insured. Third, it introduced consumer protections like limits on certain forms of coverage denial and standardized essential benefits.Now, critics often insist the law was some kind of radical experiment. But the reality is that it was built out of reforms already tested in states and negotiated through Congress. In a debate, we should at least get the basic facts right: the U.S. Constitution has 27 amendments, not 30, and the ACA did not pass with a large bipartisan bloc in the Senate. We can argue about policy design and financing, but not about civics or the calendar.", "claims": [{"claim_id": "C1", "claim_text": "The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010.", "claim_type": "DATE", "checkability": "HIGH", "evidence_hints": []}, {"claim_id": "C2", "claim_text": "The ACA established nationwide protections for people with pre-existing conditions.", "claim_type": "LAW", "checkability": "HIGH", "evidence_hints": []}, {"claim_id": "C3", "claim_text": "The U.S. Constitution has 27 amendments.", "claim_type": "NUMBER", "checkability": "HIGH", "evidence_hints": []}, {"claim_id": "C4", "claim_text": "The ACA did not pass with a large bipartisan bloc in the Senate.", "claim_type": "EVENT", "checkability": "MED", "evidence_hints": []}], "model": "HammerAI/mistral-nemo-uncensored:latest", "meta": {"attempts": [{"attempt": 1, "raw_len": 516}]}}
