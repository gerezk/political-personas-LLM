# Welcome to Politikai! 🤖🤝🤖

The purpose of this program is to give users the opportunity to get a better insight on Democrat and Republican party positions on policies and topics of interest. This program consists of three LLM personas, two represent Democrat and Republican parties, and the third acts as a fact-checker. This fact-checker evaluates the responses by the other two personas. The user can then use the fact-checker output to further prompt the political personas.

Using the app is simple:
1. Select if you want to prompt the Republican, Democrat, or both (default) using the ⚙️ icon.
2. Enter your prompt.
3. Wait for a response from the selected personas and the fact-checker. The latter's response will appear on the right-side in its own sidebar.

If there are any issues, try clearing cached files on your browser and restarting the app.
